### Input - All nine questions given in the assignment.
### Output - The right answer for the specific question.

question = "What layer of the TCP/IP model does the protocol ICMP belong to? - The answer should be an integer number"

    #Students do not have to follow the skeleton for this assignment.
    #Another way to implement is using a "case" statements similar to C.
